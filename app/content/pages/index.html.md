This document describes how to get an API key on your system in as few steps as possible.

## Install the command-line app

Install the command-line tool to get you signed-in and provision API keys.

```sh
# Run from macOS, Linux, or Windows Subsystem for Linux
$ curl -LSs https://demodx.terminalwire.sh | bash
```

## Get your API key

After installed `demodx`, you can get your API keys by running:

```sh
$ demodx apikey create
```

## That's it!

There's no step three. No pointing and clicking through a bunch of menus. Just some good ol' API keys so you can start using our service.
